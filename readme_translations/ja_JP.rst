::

   # Experimental flags
   # This section can be used to enable experimental functionality.
   # However, those features may be changed or removed at any time.
   # Options in this section is explained afterward.
   flags:
       option_one: 10
       option_two: false
       option_three: "foobar"


Tips and tricks
===============

* To send large emoji, send the emoji as text following by ``S``,
  ``M``, or ``L`` as small, medium and large emoji accordingly. For
  example, to send a large smile emoji, send ``😆L``.


Experimental flags
==================

The following flags are experimental features, may change, break, or
disappear at any time. Use at your own risk.

* ``proxy_links_by_facebook`` *(bool)* [Default: ``false``]

  Deliver links (including links in share entities and thumbnails)
  using Facebook’s proxy. Disable this option to show the source
  directly.

* ``send_link_with_description`` *(bool)* [Default: ``false``]

  When processing link message from the Master Channel, attach the
  title and description besides the link when the option is enabled.

  注釈: Regardless of this option, link messages are sent as text, and
     Facebook Messenger may or may not attach its own link preview
     per its system configuration.*

* ``show_pending_threads`` *(bool)* [Default: ``false``]

  When showing the threads list, include threads pending approval.

* ``show_archived_threads`` *(bool)* [Default: ``false``]
